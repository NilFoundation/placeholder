# Zero-Knowledge Cryptography Schemes for =nil; Foundation's Cryptography Suite

Zero-Knowledge cryptography schemes for =nil; Foundation's cryptography suite.
SNARK-alike schemes for now. More trivial Pedersen commitment schemes, STARKs,
IOP-based SNARKs, Bulletproofs etc in future.

## Building

This library uses Boost CMake build modules (https://github.com/BoostCMake/cmake_modules.git). To actually include this
library in a project it is required to:

1. Add [CMake Modules](https://github.com/BoostCMake/cmake_modules.git) as submodule to target project repository.
2. Add all the internal dependencies using [CMake Modules](https://github.com/BoostCMake/cmake_modules.git) as
   submodules to target project repository.
3. Initialize parent project with [CMake Modules](https://github.com/BoostCMake/cmake_modules.git) (Look
   at [crypto3](https://github.com/nilfoundation/crypto3.git) for the example)

## Updating from crypto3-zk repository
Update could be done either with `git format-patch` and `git am --3way --whitespace=fix --reject`, but this will lead to *.rej* files in case of conflicts.

To make it more merge-like, add `crypto3-zk` as upstream, and cherry-pick commits from it:
```bash
git remote add crypto3-zk git@github.com:NilFoundation/crypto3-zk.git
git fetch crypto3-zk
git cherry-pick <from_crypto3-zk_commit_sha>^..<to_crypto3-zk_commit_sha>
```
After transforming Crypto3 into monorepo subtree path should be specified:
```bash
git cherry-pick -Xsubtree=libs/zk <from_crypto3_commit_sha>^..<to_crypto3_commit_sha>
```
